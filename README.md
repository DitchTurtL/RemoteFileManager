# RemoteFileManager

A quick and dirty weekend project for organizing files over SSH.

I needed a way to quickly organize files between multiple directories on a remove Linux machine.

This app does so in an efficient drag & drop way.

This project uses 
- C#, .NET8, and WPF
- CommunityToolkit.MVVM
- SSH.NET
